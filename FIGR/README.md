# FIGR
Few-shot Image Generation with Reptile

The gist of this project is that the Reptile meta-learning algorithm is compatible with the GAN setup, unlike the more popular MAML meta-learning algorithm. We train GAN's for few-shot image generation on previously unseen classes on images through this approach.
